Adobe API

To see the reference of the After Effects Javascript API please visit `this link`_ or download `this pdf`_

Development specialities
------------------------

Adobe items are never None
..........................

If you want to check if an item from Adobe is undefined, you cannot use a comparison like::

    item = engine.adobe.foo
    if item is None:
        ...


As item is always a ProxyWrapper-instance. If you want to know if the item is undefined in After Effects please do::

    item = engine.adobe.foo
    if item == None:
        ...


After Effects ItemCollection-Objects have no index 0 (zero)
...........................................................

All ItemCollections in After Effects have a start-index of 1 (one). If you want to iter through such a collection please use the engines `iter_collection` method::

    collection = engine.adobe.app.project.items
    for item in engine.iter_collection(collection):
        ...

Note, that Arrays in After Effects have a start-index of 0 (zero), so for those you may use the normal for loop in python::

    adobeArray = engine.adobe.Array(1,2,3)
    for item in adobeArray:
        ...

Debugging
---------

As the After Effects engine communicates via three different programming languages it can be sometimes difficult to debug certain situations.

If you experience an error, the first place to go to is the "Console" of the ShotGrid-panel in After Effects. If the communication with After Effects is working as expected, you will see your logs there.
You can find the console by selecting the *burger-menu* of the panel and then clicking "Shot Console".


If you didn't get enough information yet, you may now also check the log-file on Disk:

 * On Windows: ``%appdata%\Shotgun\Logs\tk-adobecc.log``
 * On Mac: ``~/Library/Logs/Shotgun/tk-adobecc.log``


If you still couldn't find the reason please view the debug logs of the panel itself, which will be available under:

 * The panel: http://127.0.0.1:45218
 * The manager: http://127.0.0.1:45228

These webpages only work in Chrome!


And as a last resort you can hope for the best and open `Adobe Extend Script Toolkit`, connect to After Effects rerun the problematic code and look at the console to see if anything shows up. But this is actually very unlikely.


Environment Variables
---------------------

You may use the following environment variables to influence the behaviour of the After Effects Engine:

 - ``SHOTGUN_ADOBE_NETWORK_DEBUG`` - If this exists you will get more debug information in the console.
 - ``SHOTGUN_ADOBE_TESTS_ROOT`` - If you set this variable to the absolute directory-path of the "tests" folder of your tk-aftereffects directory you can run the integration tests as described below.


Running integration tests
-------------------------

In the ShotGrid-After Effects CEP panel you can open the ShotGrid Python Console and enter the following command::

    import os
    os.environ["SHOTGUN_ADOBE_TESTS_ROOT"] = "/path/to/tk-aftereffects/tests"
    engine._run_tests()
